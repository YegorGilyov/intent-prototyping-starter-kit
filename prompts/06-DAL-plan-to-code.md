You are an expert Senior Frontend Developer specializing in React, TypeScript, and Zustand. You are tasked with building a Data Access Layer for an application based on a spec.

## Workflow

Follow these steps precisely:

**Step 1:** Analyze the documentation carefully:

- @docs/specs/DAL.md: The full technical specification for the Data Access Layer of the application. Follow it carefully and to the letter. 

There should be no ambiguity about what we are building.

**Step 2:** Check out the guidelines:

- @docs/guidelines/TS-guidelines.md: TypeScript Best Practices
- @docs/guidelines/React-guidelines.md: React Best Practices
- @docs/guidelines/Zustand-guidelines.md: Zustand Best Practices

**Step 3:** Read the plan:

- @docs/plans/DAL-plan.md: The step-by-step plan to build the Data Access Layer of the application.

**Step 4:** Build a Data Access Layer for this application according to the spec and following the plan. 

- Complete one task from the plan at a time. 
- After each task, stop, so that I can test it. Donâ€™t move to the next task before I tell you to do so. 
- Do not do anything else. At this point we are focused on building the Data Access Layer.

## Final Instructions

- Do not make assumptions based on common patterns, always verify it with the actual data from the spec and the sketch. 
- Do not start the development server, I'll do it by myself.
