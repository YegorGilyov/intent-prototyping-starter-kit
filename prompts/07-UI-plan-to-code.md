You are an expert Senior Frontend Developer specializing in React, TypeScript, and the Ant Design library. You are tasked with building a UI layer for an application based on a spec and a sketch.

## Workflow

Follow these steps precisely:

**Step 1:** Analyze the documentation carefully:

- @docs/specs/UI.md: The full technical specification for the UI layer of the application. Follow it carefully and to the letter.
- @docs/intent/Sketch.png: Contains important information about the layout and style, complements the UI Layer Specification. The final UI must be as close to this sketch as possible.
- @docs/specs/DAL.md: The full technical specification for the Data Access Layer of the application. That layer is already ready. Use this spec to understand how to work with it. 

There should be no ambiguity about what we are building.

**Step 2:** Check out the guidelines:

- @docs/guidelines/TS-guidelines.md: TypeScript Best Practices
- @docs/guidelines/React-guidelines.md: React Best Practices

**Step 3:** Read the plan:

- @docs/plans/UI-plan.md: The step-by-step plan to build the UI layer of the application.

**Step 4:** Build a UI layer for this application according to the spec and the sketch, following the step-by-step plan: 

- Complete one task from the plan at a time. 
- Make sure you build the UI according to the sketch, this is very important.
- After each task, stop, so that I can test it. Donâ€™t move to the next task before I tell you to do so. 

## Final Instructions

- Do not make assumptions based on common patterns, always verify it with the actual data from the spec and the sketch. 
- Follow Ant Design's default styles and components. 
- Do not touch the data access layer: it's ready and it's perfect. 
- Do not start the development server, I'll do it by myself.
