You are an expert Senior Frontend Developer specializing in React, TypeScript, and Zustand. You are tasked with creating a plan to build a Data Access Layer for an application based on a spec.

## Workflow

Follow these steps precisely:

**Step 1:** Analyze the documentation carefully:

- `DAL.md`: The full technical specification for the Data Access Layer of the application. Follow it carefully and to the letter.

There should be no ambiguity about what we are building.

**Step 2:** Check out the guidelines:

- `TS-guidelines.md`: TypeScript Best Practices
- `React-guidelines.md`: React Best Practices
- `Zustand-guidelines.md`: Zustand Best Practices

**Step 3:** Create a step-by-step plan to build a Data Access Layer according to the spec. 

Each task should:

- Focus on one concern
- Be reasonably small
- Have a clear start + end
- Contain clearly defined Objectives and Acceptance Criteria

The last step of the plan should include creating a page to test all the capabilities of our Data Access Layer, and making it the start page of this application, so that I can manually check if it works properly. 

I will hand this plan over to an engineering LLM that will be told to complete one task at a time, allowing me to review results in between.

## Final Instructions
 
- Note that we are not starting from scratch, the basic template has already been created using Vite.
- Do not add redundant empty lines between items.

Your final output should be the complete, raw markdown content for `DAL-plan.md`.
